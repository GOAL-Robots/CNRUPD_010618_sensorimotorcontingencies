	Abstract = {Novelty and surprise play significant roles in animal behavior and
	in attempts to understand the neural mechanisms underlying it. They
	also play important roles in technology, where detecting observations
	that are novel or surprising is central to many applications, such
	as medical diagnosis, text processing, surveillance, and security.
	Theories of motivation, particularly of intrinsic motivation, place
	novelty and surprise among the primary factors that arouse interest,
	motivate exploratory or avoidance behavior, and drive learning. In
	many of these studies, novelty and surprise are not distinguished
	from one another: the words are used more-or-less interchangeably.
	However, while undeniably closely related, novelty and surprise are
	very different. The purpose of this article is first to highlight
	the differences between novelty and surprise and to discuss how they
	are related by presenting an extensive review of mathematical and
	computational proposals related to them, and then to explore the
	implications of this for understanding behavioral and neuroscience
	data. We argue that opportunities for improved understanding of behavior
	and its neural basis are likely being missed by failing to distinguish
	between novelty and surprise.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsic motivation, centrally involved in spontaneous exploration
	and curiosity, is a crucial concept in developmental psychology.
	It has been argued to be a crucial mechanism for open-ended cognitive
	development in humans, and as such has gathered a growing interest
	from developmental roboticists in the recent years. The goal of this
	paper is threefold. First, it provides a synthesis of the different
	approaches of intrinsic motivation in psychology. Second, by interpreting
	these approaches in a computational reinforcement learning framework,
	we argue that they are not operational and even sometimes inconsistent.
	Third, we set the ground for a systematic operational study of intrinsic
	motivation by presenting a formal typology of possible computational
	approaches. This typology is partly based on existing computational
	models, but also presents new ways of conceptualizing intrinsic motivation.
	We argue that this kind of computational typology might be useful
	for opening new avenues for research both in psychology and developmental
	robotics.},

	vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect
	external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes

@article{Horvitz2000,
	Abstract = {While it has previously been assumed that mesolimbic dopamine neurons
	carry a reward signal, recent data from single-unit, microdialysis
	and voltammetry studies suggest that these neurons respond to a large
	category of salient and arousing events, including appetitive, aversive,
	high intensity, and novel stimuli. Elevations in dopamine release
	within mesolimbic, mesocortical and nigrostriatal target sites coincide
	with arousal, and the increase in dopamine activity within target
	sites modulates a number of behavioral functions. However, because
	dopamine neurons respond to a category of salient events that extend
	beyond that of reward stimuli, dopamine levels are not likely to
	code for the reward value of encountered events. The paper (i) examines
	evidence showing that dopamine neurons respond to salient and arousing
	change in environmental conditions, regardless of the motivational
	valence of that change, and (ii) asks how this might shape our thinking
	about the role of dopamine systems in goal-directed behavior.},
